- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Rebase mechanism based on block timestamps may be manipulated.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Susceptible to front-running, especially in swapBack function.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Presence of unused code such as renounceOwnership.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or decentralized governance.

    ```solidity
    // Implement multi-signature or decentralized governance
    contract MultiSigOwnable {
        address[] private _owners;
        // Multi-signature logic
    }
    ```

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Use external oracles or unpredictable sources for timing checks.

    ```solidity
    // Use external oracle for rebase timing
    function shouldRebase(uint256 externalTimestamp) public view returns (bool) {
        require(externalOracle.validateTimestamp(externalTimestamp), "Invalid timestamp");
        return nextRebase <= externalTimestamp;
    }
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce commit-reveal schemes or other anti-front-running measures.

    ```solidity
    // Commit-reveal scheme for swapBack
    function commitSwapBack(bytes32 hash) public onlyOwner {
        // Commit hash
    }

    function revealSwapBack(uint256 amount, uint256 nonce, bytes32 secret) public onlyOwner {
        // Execute swap after verification
    }
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove functions that are not used to optimize contract size and efficiency.

    ```solidity
    // Remove unused renounceOwnership function
    // function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner { ... }
    ```

## Final Thoughts
Z-Cubed (Z3) demonstrates strong security measures, as reflected in its safety score. Addressing centralization concerns, mitigating front-running risks, and removing unused code are key areas for improvement. These enhancements will further solidify Z-Cubed's position as a secure and efficient smart contract platform, maintaining high standards of safety and reliability.
