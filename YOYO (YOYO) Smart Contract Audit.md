## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the YOYO Smart Contract. The analysis is aimed at identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0x4A88eBF6F76b04f5e0e71a351A22e573f636aFFE`

## Audit Summary
The YOYO Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **89/100** 🛡️.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: The contract contains owner-only functions that can significantly alter its behavior, including changing fee wallets and swap thresholds.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Uses block.timestamp for fee percentage and max wallet amount calculations, posing a minor risk of manipulation.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Public functions interacting with Uniswap could be susceptible to front-running in the mempool.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.x with overflow/underflow protection.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.20; updating to the latest version after testing is recommended.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Pass

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  Implement a time lock or multi-signature scheme for owner actions.

    ```solidity
    // Implementing a simple time lock mechanism
    uint256 public constant TIME_LOCK_DURATION = 2 days;
    uint256 public timeLock;

    modifier onlyOwnerAfterTimeLock() {
        require(block.timestamp >= timeLock, "Action is time locked");
        _;
    }

    function setTimeLock() external onlyOwner {
        timeLock = block.timestamp + TIME_LOCK_DURATION;
    }

    function changeWallets(address _treasuryFeeWallet, address _stakingFeeWallet, address _lpFeeWallet) public payable onlyOwnerAfterTimeLock {
        // Function body remains the same
    }
    ```

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  Ensure that the impact of timestamp manipulation is minimal.

- **Front Running**: 
  Add commit-reveal schemes or use decentralized oracles for price feeds to mitigate front-running risks.
