  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Potential manipulation in swapAndLiquify logic based on external call outcomes.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Susceptibility to front-running attacks in DEX interactions.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Functions like setBlacklist can restrict user transactions, posing a risk if misused.

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath library to prevent overflows and underflows.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Utilizes Solidity 0.8.4; updating to the latest version is advisable.

  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Non-standard functions like rescueStuckedToken could be removed for optimization.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  Implement a time-lock or multi-signature mechanism for sensitive functions.

    ```solidity
    // Adding a time-lock for setBlacklist
    function setBlacklist(address _adr, bool _status) external onlyOwner {
        require(timeLock.isTimeLockPassed(), "Time lock has not passed");
        blacklist[_adr] = _status;
    }
    ```

- **Front Running and Predictable Variables**: 
  Add mechanisms like commit-reveal schemes or slippage protection.

    ```solidity
    // Slippage protection in swapAndLiquify
    function swapAndLiquify(uint256 tAmount, uint256 minAmountOut) private lockTheSwap {
        uint256 received = swapTokensForEth(tokenForSwap);
        require(received >= minAmountOut, "Slippage limit reached");
    }
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  Remove non-essential functions to optimize the contract.

    ```solidity
    // Removing unused functions
    function rescueStuckedToken(address _token, uint _amount) external onlyOwner {
        // ...
    }

    function rescueFunds() external onlyOwner {
        // ...
    }
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The Vortex AI (VXAI) Smart Contract shows a good level of security but has notable concerns regarding centralization and potential front-running risks. Implementing measures to reduce central control and mitigate predictable outcomes will enhance the trust and safety of the contract. Updating to the latest Solidity version and removing unused code are also recommended for maintaining optimal contract efficiency and security.
