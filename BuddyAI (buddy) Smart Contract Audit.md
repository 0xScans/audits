**Contract Address**: `0x98e35F5599b57998900E5E0675721C90A5499327`

## Audit Summary
The BuddyAI (buddy) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **88/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Owner-centric functions such as setFee and updateMarketingAddress create centralization risks.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Pass

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Owner's ability to withdraw contract balance poses a potential risk.

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Lack of specific anti-front running measures.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Presence of unused private variables like _previousOwner.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or DAO for critical owner-only functions.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature or DAO control
    function setFee(...) public onlyMultiSig { ... }
    function setMaxTxnAmount(...) public onlyMultiSig { ... }
    ```

- **Ether/Token Theft**: 
  - Add checks or time locks to withdrawal functions.

    ```solidity
    // Time lock or limit withdrawals
    function manualswap() external onlyOwner { ... }
    function manualsend() external onlyOwner { ... }
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce commit-reveal schemes or other anti-front running measures.

    ```solidity
    // Anti-front running implementation
    function _transfer(...) private { ... }
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unused variables to optimize gas usage.

    ```solidity
    // Clean up unused variables
    // Remove _previousOwner variable
    ```

## Final Thoughts
BuddyAI (buddy) demonstrates a solid security foundation, but the high level of centralization and potential risks related to ether/token theft and front-running are areas of concern. Implementing decentralized control mechanisms and specific protections against theft and front-running can significantly enhance the contract's resilience. Additionally, optimizing the contract by removing unused code will further streamline its performance and efficiency.
