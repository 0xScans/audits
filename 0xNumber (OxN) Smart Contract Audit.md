- **Token/Ether Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Vulnerable to front-running in token swap transactions.

  - Details: The removeLimits function could cause issues if misused.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.19; updating recommended.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Unused functions and variables like initialBuyFee and initialSellFee.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement time-locked multisig for sensitive functions.

    ```solidity
    // Implementing multisig with a time lock
    ```

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Use more reliable randomness sources.

    ```solidity
    // Replace block.timestamp with a more reliable source
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Add commit-reveal schemes or oracle price feeds.

    ```solidity
    // Implementing commit-reveal scheme or using oracle for price feeds
    ```

- **Logical Issues**: 
  - Establish a clear governance process for invoking removeLimits.

    ```solidity
    // Governance process for removeLimits
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove or comment out unused variables and functions.

    ```solidity
    // Cleaning up unused variables and functions
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The 0xNumber (OxN) Smart Contract demonstrates a strong security posture, as indicated by its safety score. Addressing the centralization concerns, mitigating front-running risks, and removing unused code are key areas for enhancement. Implementing these recommendations will further solidify 0xNumber's position as a secure and efficient smart contract platform.
