# COPYCATDAO (CCD) Smart Contract Auditüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the COPYCATDAO (CCD) Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0xd8684Adc4664BC2a0C78dDC8657dc005E804AF15`

## Audit Summary
The COPYCATDAO (CCD) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **87/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner-only functions like updating fees and enabling/disabling trading create centralization risks.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Uses block.number, potentially exploitable by miners.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Vulnerable to front-running attacks due to lack of specific mitigation measures.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Some irreversible settings require clear communication to users.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.9 with built-in overflow checks.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Functions that cannot be unset may lead to unused code.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement multi-signature or time-lock mechanisms for critical functions.

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Replace block.number with more unpredictable variables or mitigate potential manipulation risks.

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce commit-reveal schemes or other anti-front-running measures.

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Ensure reversible mechanisms for trading and limit settings or clearly communicate their irreversibility.

## Final Thoughts
COPYCATDAO (CCD) demonstrates a solid foundation in security, but concerns about centralization, front-running vulnerability, and predictability in some variables highlight areas for improvement. Implementing decentralized control mechanisms, enhancing unpredictability in key functions, and introducing front-running protection measures are recommended. With these enhancements, COPYCATDAO (CCD) can significantly bolster its security posture and offer a more robust platform for its users.
