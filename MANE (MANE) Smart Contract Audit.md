## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner-only functions like renounceOwnership and setBuyFeePercentages centralize control, posing potential risks if compromised.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Pass

- **Token/Ether Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Potential issue in createLPPairIfRequired function leading to multiple LP pairs.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Pass

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or decentralized governance for critical functions.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature requirement example
    modifier onlyMultiSig() {
        require(isMultiSigApproved(msg.data), "Not approved by multi-sig");
        _;
    }

    function isMultiSigApproved(bytes memory data) private view returns (bool) {
        // Multi-signature verification logic
    }
    ```

- **Logical Issues**: 
  - Ensure LP pair creation is handled once to avoid split liquidity.

    ```solidity
    function createLPPair() public onlyOwner {
        require(lpPair == address(0), "LP Pair already created");
        lpPair = IUniswapV2Factory(uniswapV2Router.factory()).createPair(address(this), uniswapV2Router.WETH());
        _isExcluded[lpPair] = true;
    }
    ```

## Final Recommendations

- Address centralization concerns by implementing decentralized control mechanisms.
- Resolve the logical issue with LP pair creation to maintain a unified liquidity pool.
- Perform comprehensive testing and consider a follow-up audit post-changes.

## Final Thoughts
MANE shows a strong foundation in terms of security, but improvements in decentralization and logical consistency are needed. Addressing these areas will enhance the overall trustworthiness and functionality of the contract, ensuring a safer and more stable environment for its users.
