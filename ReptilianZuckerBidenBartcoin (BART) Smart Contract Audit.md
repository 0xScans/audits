- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: There are functions in the contract that are not being used, such as increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance. Removing or implementing these functions could help optimize the contract.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Logical Issues**: 
  - Correction: Set reasonable fee percentages after launch.
  - Example Code Correction:
    ```
    // Before
    if ((launchedAt + deadBlocks) >= block.number) {
        buyMarketingFee = 99;
        sellMarketingFee = 99;
    }
    
    // After
    // Set reasonable fee percentages after launch
    uint256 reasonableBuyFee = 5; // Example value
    uint256 reasonableSellFee = 5; // Example value
    if ((launchedAt + deadBlocks) >= block.number) {
        buyMarketingFee = reasonableBuyFee;
        sellMarketingFee = reasonableSellFee;
    }
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Consider removing or implementing the increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions if they are not needed.
