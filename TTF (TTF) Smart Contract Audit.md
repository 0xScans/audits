# TTF (TTF) Smart Contract Audit 🛡️

## Overview
This document outlines the audit findings for the TTF Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and compliance with best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0x8E32B8A41f2E86A3EE198912ac8d756C84295b40`

## Audit Summary
The TTF Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **87/100** 🛡️.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner-only functions such as setTax and setWallets centralize control, posing risks if the owner's account is compromised.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Minor use of block.timestamp in some functions, with a slight risk of miner manipulation.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Potential vulnerability to front-running due to interactions with Uniswap and lack of anti-front-running measures.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Solidity 0.8.x is used, providing built-in overflow/underflow protection.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: The contract should ensure maxWalletSize is always >= swapMinTokens.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: The removeStuckTokens function could be misused, although it's not a direct security risk.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or decentralized governance for sensitive functions.

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Minimize critical reliance on block.timestamp or remove it if unnecessary.

- **Front Running**: 
  - Add commit-reveal schemes or slippage protection to reduce front-running risks.

- **Logical Issues**: 
  - Ensure `maxWalletSize >= swapMinTokens` to prevent logical inconsistencies.

    ```solidity
    require(maxWalletSize >= swapMinTokens, "maxWalletSize should be greater than swapMinTokens");
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Consider removing or adding safeguards to administrative functions like `removeStuckTokens`.
 
## Final Thoughts
The TTF Smart Contract demonstrates a solid foundation in terms of security and efficiency. However, areas such as centralization control and potential front-running vulnerabilities warrant attention. Implementing multi-signature control and anti-front-running measures could significantly enhance the contract's robustness and trustworthiness. Overall, with the recommended improvements, TTF has the potential to offer a more secure and balanced platform for its users.
