# Liquid Rush (LIQR) Smart Contract Audit üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This audit evaluates the Liquid Rush (LIQR) smart contract to assess its security, focusing on centralization risks and best practices.

## Audit Summary
- **Contract Address**: `0x27c57f84236780881be694a18e149bb5bb78c21f`
- **Safety Score**: **92/100**

### Key Findings

### 1. Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write
- **Result:** Pass

### 2. Centralization of Control
- **Result:** Medium
- **Details:** The contract has several owner-only functions that can alter the behavior of the contract significantly. For example, the owner can exclude accounts from dividends, set exemptions from fees and limits, update tax rates, and more. This centralization could be a potential risk if the owner's account is compromised or if the owner acts maliciously.

### 3. Compiler Issues
- **Result:** Pass

### 4. Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract
- **Result:** Pass

### 5. Dependence on Predictable Variables
- **Result:** Pass

### 6. Ether/Token Theft
- **Result:** Pass

### 7. Flash Loans
- **Result:** Pass

### 8. Front Running
- **Result:** Pass

### 9. Improper Events
- **Result:** Pass

### 10. Improper Authorization Scheme
- **Result:** Medium
- **Details:** The contract uses an owner-based authorization scheme, which means that the owner has significant control over the contract's functions. This could lead to a single point of failure if the owner's account is compromised.

### 11. Integer Over/Underflow
- **Result:** Pass

### 12. Logical Issues
- **Result:** Pass

### 13. Oracle Issues
- **Result:** Pass

### 14. Outdated Compiler Version
- **Result:** Pass

### 15. Race Conditions
- **Result:** Pass

### 16. Reentrancy
- **Result:** Pass

### 17. Signature Issues
- **Result:** Pass

### 18. Sybil Attack
- **Result:** Pass

### 19. Unbounded Loops
- **Result:** Pass

### 20. Unused Code
- **Result:** Pass

Given the findings, it is recommended to consider decentralizing control by implementing a multi-signature scheme or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to mitigate the risks associated with centralization. Additionally, regular security audits and monitoring of the owner's account are advised to prevent unauthorized access and potential malicious actions.

## Code

```solidity
// Centralization of Control
function excludeFromDividends(address account) external onlyOwner {...}
function includeInDividends(address account) external onlyOwner {...}
...
function setAutomatedMarketMakerPair(address pair, bool value) public onlyOwner {...}
function setLIQRStakingCA(address stakingCA) external onlyOwner {...}
function forceSwapBack() external onlyOwner {...}
function rescueTokens(address _token, address _to) external onlyOwner {...}
function airdropToWallets(address[] memory wallets, uint256[] memory amountsInWei) external onlyOwner {...}

// Implement a multi-signature or DAO-based control mechanism
// Example using a multi-signature wallet for critical functions
modifier onlyMultiSig() {
    require(isMultiSigWallet(msg.sender), "Caller is not the multi-sig wallet");
    _;
}
function isMultiSigWallet(address _address) private view returns (bool) {
    // Logic to determine if the address is a multi-sig wallet
}
// Update all onlyOwner modifiers to onlyMultiSig
function excludeFromDividends(address account) external onlyMultiSig {...}
// Repeat for all functions previously using onlyOwner
