**Contract Address**: `0x888ceA2BBDD5D47a4032cf63668D7525C74af57A`

## Audit Summary
The Houdini Swap (POOF) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **91/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner privileges in changing fees and enabling/disabling features introduce centralization risks.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Pass

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Lack of specific anti-front running measures.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.17; updating to the latest version could offer additional security features.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Functions like renounceOwnership contribute to contract bloat.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement multi-signature or time-lock mechanisms for critical owner-only functions.

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce commit-reveal schemes or transaction ordering measures.

- **Compiler Version**: 
  - Update to the latest Solidity version for enhanced security.

    ```solidity
    // Compiler version update
    pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unused functions to optimize the contract's efficiency.

    ```solidity
    // Removing unused functions
    // e.g., renounceOwnership
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The Houdini Swap (POOF) Smart Contract demonstrates robust security measures, as evidenced by its high safety score. Addressing the centralization concerns and implementing front-running protection will further enhance its security framework. Keeping the contract updated with the latest compiler versions and removing unused code are also recommended to maintain optimal performance and security. These improvements will solidify Houdini Swap (POOF) as a secure and efficient smart contract platform.
