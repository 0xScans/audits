# NoGas (NGS) Smart Contract Auditüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the NoGas (NGS) Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0x93999D3FCab15cC052CF96b739580FC11E015944`

## Audit Summary
The NoGas Smart Contract audit resulted in a safety score of **86/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Owner-only functions like setTaxWallets and setBuyTaxes create a high level of centralization.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Minor manipulation risk with block.timestamp in addLiquidity function.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: The withdrawAll function poses a risk of unintentional Ether withdrawals.

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Susceptibility to front-running attacks in functions like _transfer.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Extensive use of onlyOwner modifier increases risk.

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Solidity ^0.8.0 includes overflow/underflow protection.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Opportunities for gas optimization and improved practices.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Recommendation to use the latest Solidity version.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Unused code could be removed for optimization.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature mechanism or DAO for critical functions.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature or DAO approval for tax changes
    function setBuyTaxes(uint256[2] memory _buyTaxes) external onlyConsensus { ... }
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Add commit-reveal schemes or use decentralized oracles for price feeds.

- **Solidity Version Update**: 
  - Upgrade to the latest Solidity version for enhanced security.

    ```solidity
    // Updating Solidity version
    pragma solidity ^0.8.17; // Latest version as of writing
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unnecessary code to optimize contract size and gas usage.

## Final Thoughts
The NoGas (NGS) Smart Contract demonstrates a strong foundation in security, but the high centralization and medium risk of front-running are key areas of concern. Implementing decentralized governance and front-running mitigation strategies would significantly enhance the trustworthiness and resilience of the contract. Additionally, updating to the latest Solidity version and optimizing the contract by removing unused code are recommended for maintaining a high standard of contract efficiency and security.
