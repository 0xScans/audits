**Contract Address**: `0xeE3c722d177559F73288cEC91fA3E4bBfd8C27Fc`

## Audit Summary
The Douglas Adams (HHGTTG) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **81/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Owner has extensive control over the contract through functions like setisExempt and setContractSwapAdams.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Vulnerability to manipulation due to predictable variables like swapTimes.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Susceptibility to front-running attacks without specific prevention measures.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Over-reliance on the onlyOwner modifier increases risk.

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: SafeMath library usage prevents arithmetic issues.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Unused SafeMath functions could be removed for gas optimization.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement time-lock mechanisms or multi-signature requirements for key functions.

    ```solidity
    // Adding a time-lock mechanism
    uint256 public constant TIME_LOCK_DURATION = 2 days;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public timelock;

    function setisExempt(address _address, bool _enabled) external onlyOwner {
        bytes32 operationHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_address, _enabled));
        require(timelock[operationHash] != 0 && timelock[operationHash] <= block.timestamp, "Operation is timelocked");
        isFeeExempt[_address] = _enabled;
        timelock[operationHash] = 0;
    }

    function timeLockOperation(address _address, bool _enabled) external onlyOwner {
        bytes32 operationHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_address, _enabled));
        timelock[operationHash] = block.timestamp + TIME_LOCK_DURATION;
    }
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The Douglas Adams (HHGTTG) Smart Contract is fundamentally strong in terms of security, but the high level of centralization and medium risk associated with predictable variables and front-running are areas of concern. Implementing time-locked operations and reducing centralization will significantly improve the contract's resilience and trustworthiness. Additionally, simplifying complex logic and removing unused code can optimize performance and enhance security. With these enhancements, the Douglas Adams (HHGTTG) contract is poised for a more robust and decentralized operation.
