## Audit Summary
The UnityBot (UnityBot) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **87/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner-only functions such as fee adjustments and swapping toggles create centralization risks.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Minor issue with block.timestamp usage for swap timing.

- **Token/Ether Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Vulnerable to front-running in DEX interactions.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: SafeMath library usage mitigates arithmetic issues.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.4; update to latest version recommended.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Unused variables like launchBlock could be removed for optimization.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement time locks or multi-signature schemes for critical functions.

    ```solidity
    // TimeLockController or MultiSigWallet for sensitive operations
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Add slippage protection in DEX interactions.

    ```solidity
    // Slippage protection in swapTokensForEth
    uniswapV2Router.swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
        tokenAmount,
        minAmountOut, // Slippage protection
        path,
        address(this),
        block.timestamp
    );
    ```

- **Compiler Version**: 
  - Update to the latest stable Solidity version.

    ```solidity
    // Update to the latest compiler version
    pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unused variables to streamline the contract.

    ```solidity
    // Remove unused variables like launchBlock
    ```

## Final Thoughts
UnityBot (UnityBot) demonstrates strong security practices, evident in its high safety score. Addressing centralization concerns, mitigating front-running risks, updating the compiler version, and removing unused code are key areas for improvement. These enhancements will further solidify UnityBot's position as a secure and efficient smart contract platform.
