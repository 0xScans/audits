# Pesabase (PESA) Smart Contract Auditüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the Pesabase (PESA) Smart Contract, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities, issues, potential threats, and problems for investors.

**Contract Address**: `0x4adc604A0261E3D340745533964FFf6bB130f3c3`

## Audit Summary
The Pesabase (PESA) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **82/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner-only functions like setBots and openTrading centralize control, posing potential misuse risks.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Uses block numbers in cooldown mechanisms, potentially exploitable.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Lacks specific anti-front running measures, allowing potential exploitation.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Role-based access control is good, but centralization risks exist.

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Complex fee structure and market hours logic could be simplified.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.0, avoiding known compiler bugs.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Susceptibility to race conditions without specific protections.

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Contains comments and potentially unused code.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Replace `onlyOwner` with role-based access control for more decentralized governance.

    ```solidity
    function setBots(address[] memory bots_, bool isBot) public onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) { ... }
    ```

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Implement a more robust mechanism that is not solely dependent on block numbers.

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce anti-front running techniques like transaction ordering.

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**: 
  - Use specific roles for critical functions like opening trading.

    ```solidity
    function openTrading() external onlyRole(TRADING_MANAGER_ROLE) { ... }
    ```

- **Race Conditions**: 
  - Apply the mutex or check-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate race conditions.

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unnecessary comments and unused code to improve readability and efficiency.

## Final Thoughts
The Pesabase (PESA) Smart Contract scores well in terms of security, but areas of concern include centralization control, potential front-running, and reliance on predictable variables. Addressing these issues through more decentralized control mechanisms, robust transaction ordering, and improving logical structures can enhance the contract's integrity and investor confidence. Overall, with the suggested improvements, Pesabase (PESA) can offer a more secure and efficient environment for its stakeholders.
