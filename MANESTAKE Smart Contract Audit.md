## Recommendations for Improvement

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement time-lock mechanisms or multi-signature requirements for sensitive operations.

    ```solidity
    // Time lock implementation for emergencyRewardWithdraw
    uint256 public constant TIME_LOCK_DURATION = 2 days;
    mapping(bytes4 => uint256) public timeLocks;

    function emergencyRewardWithdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(_amount <= rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalStaked, 'not enough tokens to take out');
        bytes4 selector = this.emergencyRewardWithdraw.selector;
        require(timeLocks[selector] != 0 && timeLocks[selector] <= block.timestamp, "Function is time-locked");
        timeLocks[selector] = 0; // Reset the time lock
        rewardToken.safeTransfer(address(msg.sender), _amount);
    }

    function initiateEmergencyRewardWithdraw() external onlyOwner {
        bytes4 selector = this.emergencyRewardWithdraw.selector;
        timeLocks[selector] = block.timestamp + TIME_LOCK_DURATION;
    }
    ```

## Final Thoughts
MANESTAKE demonstrates excellent security practices, as reflected in its high safety score. The primary area for improvement lies in reducing the centralization risk associated with owner-only functions. Implementing a time-lock mechanism as suggested will enhance the security and transparency of the contract, making it more robust against potential misuse. This enhancement, along with maintaining the current high standards, positions MANESTAKE as a secure and trustworthy smart contract.
