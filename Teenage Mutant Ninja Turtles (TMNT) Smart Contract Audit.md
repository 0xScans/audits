# Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) Smart Contract Auditüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and compliance with best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0x6F6382F241E3C6ee0e9Bee2390d91A73aDc0aFFf`

## Audit Summary
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **88/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner role has significant control over important aspects such as fees and blacklisting.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Minor impact of using `block.number` for `transferDelayEnabled`.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: No specific anti-front running measures, posing a minor risk.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Checks in place for transfers and limits, but owner can disable these checks.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses Solidity 0.8.17.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Functions related to liquidity may be unused if liquidity fees are set to zero.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or decentralized governance.

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Replace `block.number` with a less predictable mechanism.

- **Front Running**: 
  - Consider commit-reveal schemes, reordering protection, or gas price limits.

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove liquidity functions if not intended for use.

## Final Thoughts
The TMNT Smart Contract shows strong security measures, but improvements in areas such as centralization, predictability, and front-running mitigation can further enhance its robustness. Addressing these concerns through decentralized governance, less predictable variables, and front-running protections would significantly improve the contract's security posture and trustworthiness among users and investors.
