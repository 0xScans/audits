# PaLM AI (PALM) Smart Contract Audit üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the PaLM AI (PALM) Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0xf1df7305E4BAB3885caB5B1e4dFC338452a67891`

## Audit Summary
The PaLM AI (PALM) Smart Contract achieves a safety score of **83/100**.

## Detailed Audit Findings

### 1. Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write
- **Result**: Pass

### 2. Centralization of Control
- **Result**: Medium
- **Details**: The contract contains functions that centralize control in the hands of the owner, which can be a risk for investors. The owner can set fees, exclude accounts from fees, enable/disable trading, set maximum transaction amounts, and blacklist or unblacklist addresses.
***Code***:
<i>
function setTrading(bool _tradingOpen) public onlyOwner {
 tradingOpen = _tradingOpen;
}
...
function blockBots(address[] memory bots_) public onlyOwner {
...
function unblockBot(address notbot) public onlyOwner {
...
function setFee(uint256 redisFeeOnBuy, uint256 redisFeeOnSell, uint256 taxFeeOnBuy, uint256 taxFeeOnSell) public
onlyOwner {
...
function setMinSwapTokensThreshold(uint256 swapTokensAtAmount) public onlyOwner {
...
function toggleSwap(bool _swapEnabled) public onlyOwner {
...
function setMaxTxnAmount(uint256 maxTxAmount) public onlyOwner {
...
function setMaxWalletSize(uint256 maxWalletSize) public onlyOwner {
...
function excludeMultipleAccountsFromFees(address[] calldata accounts, bool excluded) public onlyOwner {
</i>

***Correction***:
No direct correction can be provided as these are design choices. However, to reduce centralization, consider
implementing a decentralized governance system where token holders can vote on critical decisions.

### 3. Compiler Issues
- **Result**: Pass

### 4. Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract
- **Result**: Pass

### 5. Dependence on Predictable Variables
- **Result**: Pass

### 6. Ether/Token Theft
- **Result**: Low
- **Details**: The contract has functions that allow the owner to manually swap and send ETH, which could potentially be used
to drain the contract of ETH if the owner's account is compromised.

***Code***:
<i>
function manualswap() external {
 require(_msgSender() == _developmentAddress || _msgSender() == _marketingAddress);
 ...
}
function manualsend() external {
 require(_msgSender() == _developmentAddress || _msgSender() == _marketingAddress);
 ...
}
</i>

***Correction***:
Consider implementing a time lock or multi-signature requirement for these sensitive functions to reduce the risk of theft.

### 7. Flash Loans
- **Result**: Pass

### 8. Front Running
- **Result**: Low
- **Details**: The contract does not appear to have specific protections against front-running, such as using a commit-reveal
scheme or similar mechanisms.

***Correction***:
Implement measures to prevent front-running, such as adding slippage protection or time delays for transactions that
interact with DEXes.

### 9. Improper Events
- **Result**: Pass

### 10. Improper Authorization Scheme
- **Result**: Medium
- **Details**: The contract uses a simple ownership model with an `onlyOwner` modifier for critical functions, which could lead
to a single point of failure if the owner's account is compromised.

***Code***:
<i>
modifier onlyOwner() {
 require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
 _;
}
...
</i>

***Correction***:
Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or a multi-signature scheme to mitigate the risks associated
with a single account having complete control over these functions.

### 11. Integer Over/Underflow
- **Result**: Pass

### 12. Logical Issues
- **Result**: Pass

### 13. Oracle Issues
- **Result**: Pass

### 14. Outdated Compiler Version
- **Result**: Pass

### 15. Race Conditions
- **Result**: Pass

### 16. Reentrancy
- **Result**: Pass

### 17. Signature Issues
- **Result**: Pass

### 18. Sybil Attack
- **Result**: Pass

### 19. Unbounded Loops
- **Result**: Pass

### 20. Unused Code
- **Result**: Low
- **Details**:  There are private variables that are set but never used, which can lead to confusion and unnecessary gas costs
during contract deployment.

***Code***:
<i>
uint256 private _redisFeeOnBuy = 0;
uint256 private _redisFeeOnSell = 0;
...
uint256 private _previousredisFee = _redisFee;
uint256 private _previoustaxFee = _taxFee;
</i>

***Correction***:
Remove unused variables or implement functionality that uses these variables to optimize the contract and reduce gas
costs.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections
- **Centralization of Control**: Implement a decentralized governance system.
- **Ether/Token Theft**: Add time locks or multi-signature requirements.
- **Front Running**: Add slippage protection or time delays.
- **Improper Authorization Scheme**: Implement RBAC or multi-signature scheme.
- **Unused Code**: Remove unused variables or implement their functionality.
