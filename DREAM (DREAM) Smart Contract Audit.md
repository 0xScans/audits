# DREAM (DREAM) Smart Contract Audit üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the DREAM Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0xb44377B74Ef1773639B663d0754cB8410A847d02`

## Audit Summary
The DREAM Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **89/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Owner-centric functions like setCooldownEnabled and setSwapEnabled create centralization risks.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Uses block.number for cooldowns and trading blocks, which can be predicted.

- **Token/Ether Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Vulnerable to front-running attacks in interactions with DEXes.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations, preventing overflows and underflows.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Redundant use of SafeMath library due to Solidity 0.8.x's built-in overflow checks.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement time-lock mechanisms or multi-signature schemes for critical functions.

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Replace block.number with more unpredictable sources or add additional measures against manipulation.

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce transaction mechanisms to reduce front-running risks, such as slippage tolerance settings or oracle price feeds.

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove SafeMath and use Solidity 0.8.x's built-in overflow and underflow checks.

    ```solidity
    // Optimizing with Solidity 0.8.x checks
    uint256 newBalance = balance + amount;
    ```

## Final Thoughts
DREAM demonstrates good security practices, but the medium centralization risk and susceptibility to front-running are areas of concern. Implementing decentralized governance and front-running mitigation strategies, along with optimizing the contract by removing redundant code, can significantly enhance the contract's overall security and efficiency. These improvements would make DREAM a more robust and trustable platform for its users.
