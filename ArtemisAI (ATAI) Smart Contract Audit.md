## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or time-locked admin function.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature or time-locked admin functions
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce commit-reveal schemes or use a decentralized oracle.

    ```solidity
    // Commit-reveal scheme or decentralized oracle implementation
    ```

- **Logical Issues (Unclog Function)**: 
  - Add an event for tracking usage.

    ```solidity
    // Event for the unclog function
    event Unclog(uint256 ethMarketing, uint256 ethDevelopment);

    function unclog() public onlyOwner lockSwapping {
        // existing code
        emit Unclog(ethMarketing, ethDevelopment);
    }
    ```

## Final Thoughts
ArtemisAI (ATAI) exhibits robust security practices but has room for improvement in reducing centralization and enhancing front-running protection. Addressing these concerns through the suggested changes will enhance the contract's security, making it a more robust and transparent platform for its users.
