# Kudoe (KDOE) Smart Contract Auditüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document provides the audit results for the Kudoe (KDOE) Smart Contract, focusing on security aspects and compliance with best practices.

**Contract Address**: `0x5f190F9082878cA141F858c1c90B4C59fe2782C5`

## Audit Summary
The Kudoe (KDOE) Smart Contract audit has concluded with a safety score of **84/100**.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Extensive control is centralized in the owner, particularly in functions like setting fees and enabling swaps.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Pass

- **Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: High
  - Details: Risk of misuse due to overuse of onlyOwner and the ability to transfer ownership without adequate checks.

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Potential issues with changing router addresses that could impact contract functionality.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Usage of a broad range of compiler versions; a specific stable version is recommended.

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Pass

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Pass

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Presence of functions like approveContractContingency which are not used within the contract.

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature scheme or DAO for key functions.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature or DAO authorization
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(isAuthorized(msg.sender), "Caller is not authorized");
        _;
    }

    function isAuthorized(address _addr) private view returns (bool) {
        // Multi-signature or DAO authorization logic
    }
    ```

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**: 
  - Make ownership transfer a two-step process.

    ```solidity
    // Two-step ownership transfer
    address public pendingOwner;

    function transferOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        pendingOwner = newOwner;
    }

    function acceptOwnership() public {
        require(msg.sender == pendingOwner, "Only the pending owner can accept ownership");
        _owner = msg.sender;
        pendingOwner = address(0);
    }
    ```

- **Logical Issues**: 
  - Add compatibility checks for the new router or a time-lock mechanism.

    ```solidity
    // Checks for router compatibility
    function setNewRouter(address newRouter) public onlyOwner {
        // Compatibility checks or time-lock mechanism
    }
    ```

- **Outdated Compiler Version**: 
  - Specify a fixed compiler version for consistency.

    ```solidity
    // Use a fixed compiler version
    pragma solidity 0.8.4;
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unused functions to optimize the contract.

    ```solidity
    // Remove functions like approveContractContingency
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The Kudoe (KDOE) Smart Contract demonstrates a strong foundation in security, but improvements are needed in decentralization and logical consistency. Implementing decentralized control mechanisms, ensuring compatibility in key functions, and using a fixed compiler version will significantly enhance the contract's robustness and trustworthiness. These enhancements, coupled with the removal of unused code, can elevate Kudoe (KDOE) to a higher standard of security and efficiency.
