## Audit Summary
The Uni Terminal Smart Contract has been audited, resulting in an overall safety score of 76.

## Audit Details

- **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
  - Result: Pass

- **Centralization of Control**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: The contract allows the owner to control key aspects like taxes and pools, posing a risk of centralization.

- **Compiler Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
  - Result: Pass

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: The use of block numbers for trading and tax application can be predictable and exploited.

- **Ether/Token Theft**
  - Result: Pass

- **Flash Loans**
  - Result: Pass

- **Front Running**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Vulnerable to front-running due to the public nature of the transfer function.

- **Improper Events**
  - Result: Pass

- **Improper Authorization Scheme**
  - Result: Pass

- **Integer Over/Underflow**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Solidity ^0.8.4 has built-in checks for overflows/underflows.

- **Logical Issues**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Inconsistencies with tax and limit settings by the owner.

- **Oracle Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Outdated Compiler Version**
  - Result: Pass
  - Details: Uses a recent compiler version (0.8.4).

- **Race Conditions**
  - Result: Medium
  - Details: Potential issues in the _distributeReward function due to state changes before external calls.

- **Reentrancy**
  - Result: Low
  - Details: Non-standard reentrancy guard implementation.

- **Signature Issues**
  - Result: Pass

- **Sybil Attack**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unbounded Loops**
  - Result: Pass

- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Potential for gas optimization.

## Recommendations

- Implement decentralized governance to reduce centralization.
- Use less predictable variables than block numbers.
- Implement standard reentrancy guards, such as those from OpenZeppelin.
- Use commit-reveal schemes to mitigate front-running risks.

## Code Snippets for Corrections

### Implement a Standard Reentrancy Guard

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract TerminalToken is ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    function addLiquidity(uint amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        // ...
    }

    function _distributeReward() internal nonReentrant {
        // ...
    }
}
