- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Pass

## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  Implement a multi-signature scheme or decentralized governance for sensitive functions.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature requirement for sensitive functions
    function setPoolCreationFee(uint256 poolCreationFee) external onlyMultipleOwners {
        _poolCreationFee = poolCreationFee;
    }
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  Introduce commit-reveal schemes to mitigate front-running risks.

    ```solidity
    // Commit-reveal scheme to prevent front-running
    function commitBet(uint256 poolId, bytes32 commitHash) external payable {
        // User submits a hash of their bet including a secret
    }

    function revealBet(uint256 poolId, uint256 betAmount, BetDirection direction, bytes32 secret) external {
        // User reveals their bet for verification
    }
    ```

- **Oracle Issues**: 
  Ensure reliability of Chainlink oracle and consider using multiple oracles for redundancy.

## Final Thoughts
The MultiplayerPoolsV1 [YoYo] Smart Contract showcases a high level of security and efficiency, reflected in its safety score. The low risk of centralization and the medium risk of front-running highlight areas for potential improvement. Implementing a multi-signature approach and additional measures against front-running could further enhance the contract's robustness. Overall, with these improvements, the MultiplayerPoolsV1 [YoYo] platform is well-positioned to provide a secure and user-centric experience.
