## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Implement a multi-signature or decentralized governance model.

    ```solidity
    // Multi-signature or governance model
    function startTrading() external onlyMultisig {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    ```

- **Dependence on Predictable Variables**: 
  - Use more secure sources of randomness or additional measures.

    ```solidity
    // Enhanced randomness or security measures
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Introduce commit-reveal schemes or decentralized oracles.

    ```solidity
    // Commit-reveal scheme or oracle integration
    ```

## Final Thoughts
Gigantix Wallet Token (GTX) demonstrates strong potential in its security design but faces challenges with centralization and front-running vulnerabilities. Addressing these concerns through recommended corrections will greatly enhance the contract's reliability and trustworthiness, ensuring a secure and efficient platform for its users.
