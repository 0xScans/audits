## Audit Summary

The VaultTech Smart Contract was subjected to a comprehensive audit covering a range of potential vulnerabilities and code quality checks. The overall safety score is **87 üõ°Ô∏è**.

### Audit Details

The following areas were covered in the audit:

1. **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
   - Result: Pass

2. **Centralization of Control**
   - Result: Medium
   - Details: Functions exist allowing the owner to alter critical parameters (fees, wallet addresses, transaction limits), posing centralization risks.

3. **Compiler Issues**
   - Result: Pass

4. **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
   - Result: Pass

5. **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
   - Result: Pass

6. **Ether/Token Theft**
   - Result: Pass

7. **Flash Loans**
   - Result: Pass

8. **Front Running**
   - Result: Pass

9. **Improper Events**
   - Result: Pass

10. **Improper Authorization Scheme**
    - Result: Medium
    - Details: The contract permits the owner to exclude addresses from fees and limits, potentially leading to unfair advantages.

11. **Integer Over/Underflow**
    - Result: Pass

12. **Logical Issues**
    - Result: Pass

13. **Oracle Issues**
    - Result: Pass

14. **Outdated Compiler Version**
    - Result: Informational
    - Details: The contract uses compiler versions from 0.6.0 to 0.9.0. Updating to the latest stable version is recommended.

15. **Race Conditions**
    - Result: Pass

16. **Reentrancy**
    - Result: Pass

17. **Signature Issues**
    - Result: Pass

18. **Sybil Attack**
    - Result: Pass

19. **Unbounded Loops**
    - Result: Pass

20. **Unused Code**
    - Result: Informational
    - Details: Instances of unused `success` variable indicate potential for gas optimization.

### Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: Implement a time lock or a multi-signature scheme for critical functions.
- **Improper Authorization Scheme**: Consider a more decentralized approach for exclusions, possibly through community governance.
- **Outdated Compiler Version**: Update to the latest stable compiler version.
- **Unused Code**: Utilize or remove the `success` variable. For error suppression, add explanatory comments.

#### Example Code Correction

```solidity
// Before
bool success;
(success,) = _taxWallets.team.call{value: teamBalance, gas: 55000}("");

// After
(bool success,) = _taxWallets.team.call{value: teamBalance, gas: 55000}("");
require(success, "Transfer Failed");
