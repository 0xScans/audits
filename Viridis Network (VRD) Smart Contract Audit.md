### 2. Centralization of Control
- **Result**: Medium
- **Details**: Owner-only functions like `launch`, `setFeeOneAddress`, and others pose centralization risks.
  
### 3. Compiler Issues
- **Result**: Pass

### 4. Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract
- **Result**: Pass

### 5. Dependence on Predictable Variables

### 6. Ether/Token Theft
- **Result**: Pass

### 7. Flash Loans
- **Result**: Pass

### 8. Front Running
- **Result**: Low
- **Details**: Susceptible to front-running during early buy penalty period.

## Conclusion
The Viridis Network (VRD) Smart Contract shows several areas that require attention to improve security and decentralization. The centralization of control and potential logical issues, such as the ability to mint new tokens, are significant concerns. Implementing more decentralized governance and clarifying the role of unused code will enhance the contract's trustworthiness and functionality.

## Recommendations
- Address centralization concerns for enhanced trust and security.
- Review and clarify the use of unused code in the contract.
- Manage minting capabilities to prevent inflationary risks.
- Consider implementing additional front-running protections.
