- **Unused Code**
  - Result: Informational
  - Details: Redundant use of SafeMath library due to Solidity 0.8.0's built-in overflow checks.

## Code Correction

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove the SafeMath library and replace all SafeMath function calls with standard arithmetic operations for gas optimization.

    ```solidity
    // Optimizing arithmetic operations using Solidity 0.8.0 checks
    // Replace SafeMath calls with direct arithmetic operations
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The Chatter Shield (SHIELD) Smart Contract demonstrates exemplary security practices, reflected in its near-perfect safety score. The only improvement identified is an informational one, related to the redundant use of the SafeMath library. Removing this redundancy will optimize the contract for gas efficiency, aligning it with the latest Solidity standards. With this enhancement, SHIELD is positioned as a highly secure and efficient smart contract platform.
