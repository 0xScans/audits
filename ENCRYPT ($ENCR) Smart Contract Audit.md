# ENCRYPT ($ENCR) Smart Contract Audit üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This document presents the audit results for the ENCRYPT ($ENCR) Smart Contract, focusing on key aspects of security and best practices, with the understanding that the contract ownership has been renounced.

**Contract Address**: `0x3A429A151ad985e678a834F9db057163181F58E8`
**Owner**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (Ownership renounced)

## Audit Summary
The ENCRYPT ($ENCR) Smart Contract has achieved a safety score of **98/100**. The ownership renouncement of the contract implies that no further modifications can be made, providing an added layer of security.

## Detailed Audit Findings

1. **Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write**
Result: Pass

3. **Centralization of Control**
Result: N/A
Details: The ownership of the contract has been renounced, eliminating risks associated with centralized control.

4. **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
Result: Pass

5. **Compiler Issues**
Result: Pass

6. **Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract**
Result: Pass

7. **Dependence on Predictable Variables**
Result: Pass

8. **Ether/Token Theft**
Result: Low
Details: The sendETHToFee function sends the contract's entire ETH balance to the _taxWallet. The risk is minimized as no new owner can be set to exploit this function.

9. **Flash Loans**
Result: Pass

10. **Front Running**
Result: Medium
Details: The contract is susceptible to front-running attacks. However, with ownership renounced, no changes can be made to implement anti-front-running measures.

11. **Improper Events**
Result: Pass

12. **Improper Authorization Scheme**
Result: N/A
Details: With renounced ownership, improper authorization is not a concern.

13. **Integer Over/Underflow**
Result: Pass

14. **Logical Issues**
Result: Pass

15. **Oracle Issues**
Result: Pass

16. **Outdated Compiler Version**
Result: Informational
Details: The contract uses Solidity version 0.8.9.

17. **Race Conditions**
Result: Pass

18. **Reentrancy**
Result: Pass

19. **Signature Issues**
Result: Pass

20. **Sybil Attack**
Result: Pass

21. **Unbounded Loops**
Result: Pass

22. **Unused Code**
Result: Pass

## Final Remarks
The ENCRYPT ($ENCR) Smart Contract demonstrates a strong security posture. The renouncement of contract ownership solidifies its operational integrity, ensuring that the code cannot be altered. While certain risks like front-running remain, they are inherent to the design and cannot be addressed due to the renounced ownership.
