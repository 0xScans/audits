## Recommendations for Code Corrections

- **Centralization of Control**: 
  - Consider a multi-signature or decentralized governance model.

    ```solidity
    // Conceptual change for multi-signature or decentralized governance
    ```

- **Front Running**: 
  - Implement commit-reveal schemes for critical operations.

    ```solidity
    // Commit-reveal scheme for mitigating front-running
    function commitAction(bytes32 _hash) public { /*...*/ }
    function revealAction(bytes32 _secret) public { /*...*/ }
    ```

- **Unused Code**: 
  - Remove unused functions to streamline the contract.

    ```solidity
    // Removal of unused functions
    // function renounceOwnership() { /*...*/ }
    // function transferOwnership(address newOwner) { /*...*/ }
    ```

## Final Thoughts
The Baby Bonk (BabyBonk) Smart Contract demonstrates solid security practices, evident in its safety score.
