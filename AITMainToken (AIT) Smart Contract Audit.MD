# AITMainToken (AIT) Smart Contract Audit üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This audit assesses the AITMainToken (AIT) smart contract for security practices and potential vulnerabilities, with a focus on centralization risks and dependency on predictable variables.

## Audit Summary
- **Contract Address**: `0x89d584a1edb3a70b3b07963f9a3ea5399e38b136`
- **Safety Score**: **88/100**

## Detailed Audit Findings

#### (1) Arbitrary Jump/Storage Write
- **Result:** Pass

#### (2) Centralization of Control
- **Result:** Medium
- **Details:** The contract uses an Ownable pattern, introducing a level of centralization with exclusive rights for the owner to execute significant functions such as renounceOwnership, transferOwnership, setConfig, setSendVersion, setReceiveVersion, forceResumeReceive, setTrustedRemote, setTrustedRemoteAddress, setPrecrime, setMinDstGas, setPayloadSizeLimit, changeTreasuryReceiver, changeFeeStatus, setExcludedFees, setTaxes, setTaxesFirstDay, and setLpPair. This could pose a risk if the owner's account is compromised.
- **Correction:** Consider using a role-based access control system, replacing the `onlyOwner` modifier with a more decentralized approach such as requiring a role assigned through the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

#### (3) Compiler Issues
- **Result:** Pass

#### (4) Delegate Call to Untrusted Contract
- **Result:** Pass

#### (5) Dependence on Predictable Variables
- **Result:** Medium
- **Details:** The fee mechanism is based on the block timestamp, which miners can slightly manipulate, potentially leading to exploitation for more favorable fee rates.
- **Correction:** Consider using an oracle or a commit-reveal scheme for time-dependent logic.

#### (6) Ether/Token Theft
- **Result:** Pass

#### (7) Flash Loans
- **Result:** Pass

#### (8) Front Running
- **Result:** Medium
- **Details:** Vulnerable to front-running due to using the block timestamp for fee calculations, allowing malicious users to potentially manipulate transaction outcomes.
- **Correction:** Implement measures against front-running, such as using commit-reveal schemes.

#### (9) Improper Events
- **Result:** Pass

#### (10) Improper Authorization Scheme
- **Result:** Pass

#### (11) Integer Over/Underflow
- **Result:** Pass

#### (12) Logical Issues
- **Result:** Pass

#### (13) Oracle Issues
- **Result:** Pass

#### (14) Outdated Compiler Version
- **Result:** Pass

#### (15) Race Conditions
- **Result:** Pass

#### (16) Reentrancy
- **Result:** Pass

#### (17) Signature Issues
- **Result:** Pass

#### (18) Sybil Attack
- **Result:** Pass

#### (19) Unbounded Loops
- **Result:** Pass

#### (20) Unused Code
- **Result:** Pass

### Recommendations

The findings highlight significant concerns with the centralization of control and dependence on predictable variables. It is recommended to implement a role-based access control system and explore alternative mechanisms for time-dependent logic to mitigate these issues.
